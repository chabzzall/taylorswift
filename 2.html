<h2>Lover</h2>
  <p>Lover is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on August 23, 2019, through Republic Records. As the executive producer, Swift enlisted producers Jack Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little for the project.

  Inspired by the connections felt with fans during her Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), Swift sought to make an album with bright and lighter tones by delving deep into her personal life, departing from the dark sound of its predecessor, Reputation (2017). She defined Lover as a "love letter to love itself" that celebrates the full spectrum of love. It also incorporates politically charged themes, such as feminism, disillusionment and LGBT rights. Lover is primarily a 1980s retro-styled pop record that combines synth-pop, electropop and pop rock with influences from country, funk, folk and R&B. The album's artwork and visuals use a summer theme consisting of pastel colors.
